2. Introduction: This project leverages hand gesture recognition to control the mouse cursor using hand movements.
   It uses a library for detecting hand landmarks (joints) and captures their positions to enable various interactions like moving the cursor and performing click actions through hand gestures.
   The Hand Gesture Mouse Control project allows users to control the mouse pointer through hand movements detected by a webcam. The system recognizes specific hand gestures to perform actions such as clicking. For example:
    - **Open hand**: Moves the mouse cursor.
    - **Closed fist**: Performs a mouse click.
3. Technologies Used:
    - **Hand Tracking Library**: Detects hand landmarks (joints) and provides their coordinates for gesture recognition.
    - **Python**: The core programming language used for this project.
    - **OpenCV**: For capturing video from the webcam and processing frames.
    - **PyAutoGUI**: For simulating mouse movements and clicks based on hand gestures.
4. Features
    - **Hand Movement Control**: Move the mouse cursor by moving your hand in front of the webcam.
    - **Gesture-Based Clicks**: Perform a mouse click by closing your fist.
    - **Smooth Cursor Movement**: Ensures a natural and intuitive control experience.
    - **Real-Time Processing**: Gesture recognition and cursor control occur in real-time.
5. Installation
   - git clone this project
   - run command "pip install -r "setup.txt"
